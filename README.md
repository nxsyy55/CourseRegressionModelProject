Question
----------------------------
You work for Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry. Looking at a data set of a collection of cars, they are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). They are particularly interested in the following two questions:

“Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG”
“Quantifying how different is the MPG between automatic and manual transmissions?”

Take the mtcars data set and write up an analysis to answer their question using regression models and exploratory data analyses.

Your report must be:

Written as a PDF printout of a compiled (using knitr) R markdown document.
Do not use any packages that are not in R-base or the library datasets.
Brief. Roughly the equivalent of 2 pages or less for the main text. Supporting figures in an appendix can be included up to 5 total pages including the 2 for the main report. The appendix can only include figures.
Include a first paragraph executive summary.
